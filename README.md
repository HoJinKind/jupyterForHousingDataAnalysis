# Threading the property Market in singapore.
## Rent or buy? 
Given a situation where an adult is given the option to buy, assuming he has sufficient for a down payment, should he or she go on to buy a property? Is property truly an asset?

Here, we will consider a specific private apartment, ParkView situated in Singapore, with relatively low variables, (no launch of MRT), to fully capture the depreciation of property as an asset, ceteris paribus. The analysis will span a period of 20 years, since its launch in 1998.


## Defining the problem/ Scoping
To do an anlysis of which is better, it is important that we define the factors we will need, the variables, to make an accurate analysis. Hence, i will be laying them down here.
They consist of:
    1. Transaction Prices
    2. CPI
    3. Interest Rates
    4. Rental
